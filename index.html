<p>The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments.<br>
In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.<br>
Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin,<br>
that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands,<br>
or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound.<br>
There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum.<br>
Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll.<br>
Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments,<br>
and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged <br>
for thousands of years.The image of a modern drum kit is shown

<h2 style="font-family:verdana">Components of a modern drum kit</h2>
<hr>
<a href="snare.html"><h3>Snare</h3></a>
<img src="snare.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="snare">
<p>The snare drum provides the backbeat. When applied in this fashion,<br>
it supplies strong regular accents played by the non-dominant hand and is<br>
the backbone for many fills. Its distinctive sound can be attributed to the<br>
bed of stiff metal wires held under tension against the bottom head <br>
(known as the snare head).</p>

<br>

<a href="toms.html"><h3>Toms</h3></a>

<img src="toms.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="toms">
<p>Tom-tom drums, or toms for short, are drums without snares<br>
and played with sticks (or whatever tools the music style requires) and<br>
are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most<br>
drum fills and solos.</p>

<br>

<a href="bass.html"><h3>Bass drum</h3></a>

<img src="bass.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="bass_drum">
<p>The bass drum (also known as the "kick drum")<br>
is the lowest-pitched drum and usually provides the beat or timing element with<br>
basic pulse patterns. Some drummers may use two or more bass drums or a double pedal<br>
on a single bass drum, which enables a drummer to play a double-bass-drum style with<br>
only one drum. This saves space in recording/performance areas and reduces time and<br>
effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation. Double bass drumming is a<br>
technique used in certain genres, including heavy metal and progressive rock.</p>

<br>

<a href="cymbals.html"><h3>Cymbals</h3></a>

<img src="cymbals.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="cymbals">

<p>In most drum kits and drum/percussion kits, cymbals<br>
are as prominent as the drums themselves. The oldest idiophones in music are cymbals,<br>
a version of which were used throughout the ancient Near East very early in the Bronze<br>
Age period. Cymbals are mostly associated with Turkey and Turkish craftsmanship,<br>
where Zildjian has made them since 1623.<br>

While most drummers purchase cymbals individually, beginner cymbal packs were brought<br>
to market to provide entry-level cymbals for the novice drummer. The kits normally<br>
contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. Some contain only<br>
three cymbals, using a crash/ride instead of the separate ride and crash. The sizes<br>
closely follow those given in Common configurations below. Most drummers extend the<br>
normal configuration by adding another crash, a splash, and/or a china/effects cymbal.</p>

<p><b>Groove:</b> The backbone of any rhythm, groove<br>
involves maintaining a steady beat.It’s the foundation for the entire band,<br>
often played on the hi-hat or ride cymbal.<br>

<b>Solo:</b> A chance for the drummer to shine! Solos are intricate patterns that<br>
showcase technical skills and creativity. They can be short bursts or extended<br>
performances.<br>

<b>Fills:</b> These patterns deviate from the main groove and serve as transitions<br>
between song sections. Fills can be simple or complex, adding excitement and<br>
variety. Common durations include full bars, half bars, and quarter bars.<br>
